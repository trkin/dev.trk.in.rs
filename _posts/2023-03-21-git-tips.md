## Git style

For Git we follows this guides

* https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/git

For code review

* https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review

When working on some task, for example issue 123 than we usually create a branch
that looks like `i#{issue number}_#{description}` and use commit number at the
end `git commit -m'#{some description} ##{issue number}`
For example

```
git checkout -b i123_add_test_for_signup
# make changes
git commit -m'Add test for signup #123`
git push -u origin i123_add_test_for_signup
```

## Gitflow

For big projects we follow GitFlow
so all PR are done on `develop` branch. Only `i123_hotfix_something` branch
start from `main` and merged back to `develop` and `main`.

## Github cli

We also use gh cli

```
gh pr merge -r -d
```
