As a practice task in our [first intership]({% link _posts/2023-01-04-intership.md })
we are building a webapp that will help parents organize themselves and find free places in
kindergartens that are closer to them. When there are no vacancies the only
way to move the kids to another kindergarten is to find someone else who also
wants to move.

Main tools that we will use:
* [Ruby on rails]({% link _posts/2023-01-24-learning-materials-for-ruby-and-rails.md %})
  as a server side engine
* Github projects for organizing tasks
* Neo4j graph database to find matches in rotations
* Figma for designs
* Tailwind for styles
* Jekyll for blog

All practicioners should choose one area in which to become a master so they can
teach other teammates.
